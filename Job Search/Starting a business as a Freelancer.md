**Argument for fixed charge** If you have a skill that allows you to do something fast that really benefits your client you are cheating your self charging hourly.
**Considerations:** How much is the work worth to me? How much is it worth to the client?

## **Clarify all costs** 
Don't assume the client understands how your business works.
**Always give a longer timeline** than you expect, so in delivering early the Client is pleasantly surprised.
**Exact Quote for Exact Work**. Have client sign proposal and create a new proposal and get signature on any **added work**

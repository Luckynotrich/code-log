I have a solid understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I have experience with RESTful APIs and third-party libraries. I am familiar with version control systems, particularly Git, and I have strong problem-solving and debugging skills. I am able to work independently and collaboratively in a team environment, and I have excellent communication and interpersonal skills.

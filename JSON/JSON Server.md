JSON Server is a Node Module that you can use to create demo rest JSON web service in less than a minute. All you need is a JSON file for sample data.

##### Step #1 - Install JSON Server
```
npm i json-server
```

##### Step #2 - Create a JSON File

##### Step #3 - Create Data
Define your data inside the JSON file. This JSON data can be an array of objects or an object with nested objects. Each object represents a data entity and should each have a unique id.

##### Step #4 - Start the Server
Start up the JSON Server by typing this command into your terminal: `json-server --watch db.json`. This will run on "https://localhost:3000" by default. You can change the port it's running on by specifying a different port number when starting the server using the `--port` flag.

JSON Server will automatically generate Restful endpoints based on the data you defined in your JSON file.

If you have a JSON file with an array of "users", this is the endpoint that will be automatically generated by the JSON Server:

- GET Â /users - This retrieves a list of all resource entities of users.
- GET /users/:id - This retrieves a specific user by its id.
- POST /users - This creates a new user.
- PUT /users/:id - This updates a user based on a specified id.
- DELETE /users/:id - This deletes a user based on the specified id.

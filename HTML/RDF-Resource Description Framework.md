## Overview

RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.

RDF extends the linking structure of the Web to use URIs to name the relationship between things as well as the two ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a “triple”). Using this simple model, it allows structured and semi-structured data to be mixed, exposed, and shared across different applications.

This linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph, where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes. This _graph view_ is the easiest possible mental model for RDF and is often used in easy-to-understand visual explanations.

## Recommended Reading

The RDF 1.1 specification consists of a [suite of W3C Recommendations](http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf) and Working Group Notes, published in 2014. This suite also includes an [RDF Primer](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/). See also Tim Berners-Lee’s writings on [Web Design Issues](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/), including [Metadata Architecture](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Metadata). Other technologies, like [OWL](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/OWL "OWL") or [SKOS](http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/wiki/Main_Page), build on RDF and provide language for defining structured, Web-based ontologies which enable richer integration and interoperability of data among descriptive communities.

A number of textbooks have been published on RDF and on Semantic Web in general. Please, refer to a [separate page](https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/Books "Books") listing some of those, as maintained by the community. That list also includes references to conference proceedings and article collections that might be of general interest.

## Discussions on a possible next version of RDF

W3C has recently set up a new [RDF Working Group](http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/wiki/Main_Page), whose charter is to make a minor revision of RDF.

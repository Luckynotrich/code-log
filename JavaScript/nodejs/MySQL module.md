This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Node.js 0.6 or higher is required.

Installation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

For information about the previous 0.9.x releases, visit the [v0.9 branch](https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql/tree/v0.9).

Sometimes I may also ask you to install the latest version from Github to check if a bugfix is working. In this case, please do:
```sh
npm install mysqljs/mysql
```
for Typescript
```sh
npm install --save @types/mysql

```

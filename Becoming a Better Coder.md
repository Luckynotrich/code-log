First:
1) Lay out what it is that you are Building
	 Define what are the requirements .
**Ultimately gaining a clear understanding** of what you are doing.
	Think about how it fits in the code base.
		a) Think about constants you can utilize
		b) Think about the **Readability** 
		c) **Maintainability**
		d) **Scalability** of your code.
2) *Commit Often*: Big changes make big problems
		a) A **Pull request** should have just *one Cohesive Feature* 
		b) Break big features up into multiple logical parts
		c) Create a check list of steps to get feature working.
			I)Test each step as it is completed then commit it.
			II)Test that the feature as a whole is working, PUSH it and then create a Pull Request.
3) *Master the Code base you know* and Master the **Concepts of Programming** before moving on to a new language.
4) **Work on One Thing At A Time.** Building software is a slower process than you think. Don't START ON a NEW task until you have completed the one you are working on.
5) `Don't Avoid Critiques!`**Seek Criticism** as a learning opportunity.

| [07:44:26] | Richard Haskell: Ok, thanks. A then once the ssl cert is renewed do I have to do something else?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [07:44:51] | Jeevitha S.: Once the SSL is renewed, you can enable the proxy status ON for [newledohub.org](http://newledohub.org).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [07:45:02] | Jeevitha S.: Please note, any changes to DNS takes 4-6 hours to propagate,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [07:45:57] | Richard Haskell: And AutoSSL will notify me when it is renewed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [07:46:54] | Jeevitha S.: Once the proxy is disabled and A record for subdomains are updated then you can follow the below help article to RUn AutoSSL: [https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/cpanel/cpanel-security-features/reconfiguring-autossl-on-domains/#Reconfiguring-AutoSSL](https://www.a2hosting.com/kb/cpanel/cpanel-security-features/reconfiguring-autossl-on-domains/#Reconfiguring-AutoSSL) |
| [07:47:06] | Jeevitha S.: No, the email wont be received. You can enable it manually.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

To set a Tailwind CSS color that controls a form field's submit action, you'll likely want to use the `focus:` variant to change the appearance of the submit button or field when it's focused (e.g., the user clicks to enter the field). You can also use `hover:` and `active:` variants for additional visual feedback on hover and when the submit button is pressed. 

Here's how you might achieve this:

1. **1.** **Target the Button or Field:**
    
    You'll need to apply the relevant Tailwind CSS classes to your submit button or the form field itself. 
    

- **2.** Apply `focus:`:
    
    Use `focus:border-[color]`, `focus:outline-[color]`, `focus:bg-[color]`, `focus:text-[color]`, or other relevant color utilities to modify the appearance when focused. For example, `focus:border-blue-500 focus:outline-blue-500 focus:bg-blue-100` would change the border and outline color to a blue shade, and the background to a lighter blue on focus. 
    

- **3.** Optional `hover:` and `active:`:
    
    For added visual feedback, use `hover:bg-[color]`, `active:bg-[color]` to change the background color on hover and when the button is pressed, respectively. 
    

- **4.** **Custom Colors:**
    
    If you need colors outside of Tailwind's default palette, you can customize your theme using the `@theme` directive, [as explained in Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors). 
    

Example:
```html

<button type="submit" class="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-700 focus:outline-none focus:border-green-700 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Submit
</button>
```

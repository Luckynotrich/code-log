When you migrate your React applications from Javascript to Typescript you want everything to be typed right! and If you start having the type **any** it means that you are in the wrong direction üòû

Ok cool, you have to create your own types, interfaces... but what about React types, for instance React Events types.  
For instance you have a submit event  

```ts
 const handleSubmit = (event) =>; {
    event.preventDefault()
    const data = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
    console.log({
      email: data.get('email'),
      password: data.get('password'),
    })
  }
```

Typescript is complaining and you need to provide a type for your event

You need to know what type is your **event** here, but how? ü§î  
All what you have to do is to write an inline event handler and hover over the event parameter to know that it's of type `React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>` üëç

Great! Here is your new code and Typescript is happy  

```ts

const handleSubmit = (event: React.FormEvent;<HTMLFormElement>;) =>; {
 ...
```

Till now everything is good but can't you see that it's a long ugly type üò´ You can make it shorter and nicer.

Let us create a new types file **types.ts** where we can create new types or in our case only renaming existing ugly ones. Examples bellow  

```
type FormEvent = React.FormEvent&lt;HTMLFormElement&gt;
type MouseEvent = React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLButtonElement&gt;
type ChangeEvent = React.ChangeEvent&lt;HTMLInputElement&gt;
...

export { FormEvent, MouseEvent, ChangeEvent };
```

Now our `React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>` type became _**FormEvent**_ üòé

Again here is how our code will look like now  

```
import { FormEvent } from './types'

const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent) =&gt; {
 ...
```

Short, Clean and Correct.

Thanks for reading and hope it was helpful

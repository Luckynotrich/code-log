/* aninmation-notes.css */
CSS animation depends on keyframes rule that designate the appearence in terms of percentage of a duration.

    div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: red;
    position: relative;
    animation-name: example;
    animation-duration: 4s;
    animation-delay: 2s;
    /* <!-- delay can be set to negative so animation starts in middle of execution --> */
    }


    @keyframes example {
    0%   {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
    25%  {background-color:yellow; left:200px; top:0px;}
    50%  {background-color:blue; left:200px; top:200px;}
    75%  {background-color:green; left:0px; top:200px;}
    100% {background-color:red; left:0px; top:0px;}
    }

    Specify the Speed Curve of the Animation

The animation-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the animation.

The animation-timing-function property can have the following values:

    ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
    linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
    ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
    ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
    ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
    cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function
    
Specify the fill-mode For an Animation

CSS animations do not affect an element before the first keyframe is played or after the last keyframe is played. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.

The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the target element when the animation is not playing (before it starts, after it ends, or both).

The animation-fill-mode property can have the following values:

    none - Default value. Animation will not apply any styles to the element before or after it is executing
    forwards - The element will retain the style values that is set by the last keyframe (depends on animation-direction and animation-iteration-count)
    backwards - The element will get the style values that is set by the first keyframe (depends on animation-direction), and retain this during the animation-delay period
    both - The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards, extending the animation properties in both directions

Hello friends!  Today I am sharing a recipe that I spent years perfecting.  This is my recipe for the Best Thai Peanut Sauce Ever.  I use this recipe as a peanut dipping sauce, as a dressing for salads, to make peanut noodles and anything else I think needs a punch of flavor from peanut sauce.

## How do you make Thai Peanut Sauce?

This recipe for Thai Peanut Sauce uses everyday ingredients that are easy to find at the grocery store.  Although many Thai peanut sauce recipes use coconut milk, this peanut sauce recipe does not.  All you need to do is whisk together peanut butter with soy sauce, rice vinegar, lime juice, chili garlic sauce, brown sugar, ginger, garlic and water.  This is a simple, no cook peanut sauce!![How to make the best Thai Peanut Sauce ever!  This Peanut Sauce Recipe can be used as a dipping sauce, salad dressing, for peanut noodles or with chicken satay. | Easy peanut Sauce Recipe | Peanut Dipping Sauce for spring rolls | Peanut noodle sauce | Asian Peanut Sauce | Spicy Peanut Sauce | Peanut Dressing | Vegan Peanut Sauce | Gluten Free Peanut Sauce ](https://www.foxandbriar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/best-ever-peanut-sauce-2-of-5.jpg)  
A few notes about this recipe:

-   You can make this spicy peanut sauce by using more chili garlic sauce.  You can sub sriracha if you have it on hand, but I prefer the flavor of chili garlic sauce.
-   You can use honey instead of brown sugar, however I find that the flavor of the peanut sauce is better with brown sugar.
-   Use more water to thin the sauce and use as a peanut sauce dressing for salad.
-   What can you dip in this peanut sauce? Spring rolls, [lettuce wraps](https://www.foxandbriar.com/ginger-peanut-lettuce-wraps/), veggies, chicken, [coconut shrimp](https://www.foxandbriar.com/make-best-baked-coconut-shrimp/), tofu.  You can use this peanut dipping sauce for just about anything!

Prep Time: 5 minutes

Total Time: 5 minutes

Servings: 1 Cups

Calories: 226kcal

-   1/2 cup [peanut butter](https://www.foxandbriar.com/best-easiest-homemade-peanut-butter/) natural, unsweetened
-   2 tablespoons [low sodium soy sauce](https://amzn.to/2CDjCGO) use tamari or coconut aminos for gluten free
-   1 tablespoon [rice vinegar](https://amzn.to/2QiCmOM)
-   2 tablespoons brown sugar
-   2 teaspoons [chili garlic sauce](https://amzn.to/2oSjklG) more or less to taste
-   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
-   3 [garlic cloves](https://www.foxandbriar.com/tag/garlic/) pressed or grated
-   1 tablespoon ginger root grated
-   2-4 tablespoons warm water

-   Combine all ingredients except water.  Whisk to fully combine.
    
-   Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached. I normally use 2 tablespoons for a sauce and up to four if using it for a dressing. 
    

I use unsweetened peanut butter.  If you use conventional peanut butter the sauce may turn out too sweet.  Try reducing the brown sugar to 1 tablespoon.

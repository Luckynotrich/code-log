Questions to ask:

  

Are they sealed batteries? If yes, you don't want them because they can't be reliably tested.  

What brand? Crown or Trojan strongly preferred

What model(s)? e.g. Trojan T-105  

What is the amp-hour (Ah) rating? 225Ah is typical for a golf cart battery

What voltage: 6V typical for GC batteries; need 4X for 24V design point

What is their reconditioning procedure? Possibilities:

1. Ethically questionable, not acceptable: charging battery, checking the resting voltage or simply using a "smart charger/reconditioner" and checking that the LED is green  
    
2. Slightly better: checking electrolyte level, adjusting if necessary (adding distilled water), charging battery, load testing
3. Definitive: testing the specific gravity of each cell, equalizing if necessary (slight overcharge until s.g. variances between cells is minimal and s.g. is in the 'good' range)  
    

If not number 3, will they replace any battery that doesn't pass the test when you test it?

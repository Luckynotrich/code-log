LA Deep cycle renewable energy batteries
Golf cart, forklift, Trojan~T105re
Highly test-able unlike 'Sealed LA'

Specific Gravity is the definitive test-requires rubber clothing and face sheild

DP--2x 6v DC Golf cart batteries

Lithium buy new

12v advantages= lots of automotive components run on 12v

12v disadvantages= wiring for higher voltage is expensive. Copper and fuses are expensive and requires special tools.

24v eg: 4x 6v advantages: thinner wire, more flexible, cheaper fuses,

24v disadvantages 2x battery weight, requires down converter to run 12v components. Smaller inverter selection 

Solar charge control feeds power from panels to battery at between 13.4v-14.6v.

USB converts 12v to 5v

An inverter is required to get 110v. Size inverter and solar panels for winter use and disconnect panels in the summer 

Fuses
Battery can put out 600amps Ã— 13.4v = 8040w.
Main fuse is between charge controller and batteries is highly critical.

Fuses between charge controller is less critical.

USB charger requires automotive fuse

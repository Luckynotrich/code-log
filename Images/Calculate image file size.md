To calculate the file size of a digital image, you can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pixels: Multiply the number of horizontal pixels by the number of vertical pixels
2. Calculate the total number of bits: Multiply the total number of pixels by the bit depth
3. Calculate the file size in bytes: Divide the total number of bits by 8
4. Calculate the file size in kilobytes: Divide the number of bytes by 1024
5. Calculate the file size in megabytes: Divide the number of kilobytes by 1024Â 

The bit depth refers to the number of colors available in the image. The more colors an image has, the more bits per pixel are needed, which results in a larger file size. The image quality settings selected on the camera also affect the file size.

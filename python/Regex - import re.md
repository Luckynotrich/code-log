Python's `re` module enables the use of regular expressions, which are powerful tools for pattern matching within strings. Here's a breakdown of key concepts and functionalities:

1. Importing the `re` module:
- Begin by importing the module using `import re`.
2. Core functions:
	- `re.search(pattern, string)`: Scans the string for the first location where the pattern matches, returning a match object if found, or `None` otherwise.
	- `re.match(pattern, string)`: Checks if the pattern matches only at the beginning of the string. Returns a match object if found, or `None` otherwise.Â 
	- `re.findall(pattern, string)`: Finds all occurrences of the pattern in the string and returns them as a list of strings.
	- `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`: Replaces all occurrences of the pattern in the string with the replacement string.
	- `re.split(pattern, string)`: Splits the string wherever the pattern matches, returning a list of strings.
- `re.compile(pattern)`: Compiles a regular expression pattern into a regex object, which can then be reused for multiple operations.
3. Basic syntax:
	- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.
	- `^`: Matches the beginning of the string.
	- `$`: Matches the end of the string.
	- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
	- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
	- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character or group.
	- `{m}`: Matches exactly m occurrences of the preceding character or group.
	- `{m,n}`: Matches between m and n occurrences of the preceding character or group.
	- `[]`: Matches any single character within the brackets. E.g., `[abc]` matches either "a", "b", or "c".
	- `[^]`: Matches any single character not within the brackets. E.g., `[^abc]` matches any character except "a", "b", or "c".
	- **`\`**: Escapes special characters or introduces character classes. E.g., `\d` (digit), `\w` (alphanumeric), `\s` (whitespace).

4. Raw strings:
	- Use raw strings (prefixed with `r`) to avoid excessive escaping of backslashes, e.g., `r"\d+"`.
5. Example:
```python
   import re

   text = "The price is 123 dollars."
   match = re.search(r"\d+", text)
   if match:
     print("Found a match:", match.group()) # Output: Found a match: 123

   matches = re.findall(r"\d+", "123 apples and 456 oranges")
   print("All matches:", matches) # Output: All matches: ['123', '456']

   result = re.sub(r"apples", "bananas", "I like apples")
   print("Replaced text:", result) # Output: Replaced text: I like bananas
```

In this example, the `Popen` class is used to create two child processes, one for the ls command and one for the grep command. The stdout of the ls command is connected to the stdin of the grep command using `subprocess.PIPE`, which creates a pipe between the two processes. The `communicate()` method is used to send the output of the `ls` command to the `grep` command and retrieve the filtered output.

```python
import subprocess

ls_process = subprocess.Popen(["ls"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

grep_process = subprocess.Popen(["grep", "sample"], stdin=ls_process.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, text=True)

output, error = grep_process.communicate()

print(output)

print(error)
```

Output:
```sh
sample_data
```

Python `subprocess` module provides a way to create and interact with child processes, which can be used to run other programs or commands. One of the features of the subprocess module is the ability to create pipes, which allow communication between the parent and child processes.

A pipe is a unidirectional communication channel that connects one process's standard output to another's standard input. A pipe can connect the output of one command to the input of another, allowing the output of the first command to be used as input to the second command.

Pipes can be created using the `subprocess` module with the Popen class by specifying the stdout or stdin argument as `subprocess.PIPE`.

For example, the following code creates a pipe that connects the output of the ls command to the input of the grep command, which filters the output to show only the lines that contain the word `"file"`:
